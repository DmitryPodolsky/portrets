            <p class="block-text common-p-1" id="ach-0">Portraits of Honor was developed in 1999 under the direction of Dr.
              Charles Silow, the son of Holocaust Survivors. Its purpose is to document the lives of Holocaust Survivors who have lived in
              Michigan for education and for posterity. Portraits of Honor is a learning tool about the lives of Survivors through their photographs,
              biographies, and historical references. As you look at the portraits of the Survivors,
              you will see faces of pain and suffering as well as faces reflecting beauty, resilience, and the triumph of the human spirit. </p>

            <p class="block-text common-p-1">When, one by one, the national armies of European countries were defeated in World War II,
              the Jewish populations within these countries found themselves in helpless and powerless situations. They were, by and large, civilians with little military training.
              They had almost no access to weapons and their national armies had been overrun by Nazi Germany. </p>
            <p class="block-text common-p-1">Portraits of Honor cherishes and honors each and every Michigan Survivor. For so long,
              the Holocaust Survivors of our community have not been appreciated for what they endured and for
              all that they have achieved in their lives after the war.  </p>
            <p class="block-text common-p-1">After the Holocaust, these Survivors came to America and made their way to Michigan.
              They learned a new language, a new culture, and built new lives. Most married, worked hard, and raised families.
              The memories of the overwhelming losses and horrors they experienced have continued to haunt them and yet they have been able to go on with life.
              Their children, grandchildren, and even great- grandchildren are here and contribute to society.
              In spite of the Nazi attempted genocide, the Jewish people have continued and thrive.
              To quote from the "Song of the Partisans," the unofficial anthem of the Survivors, "Mir zeinen du!" "We are here!" </p>

            <p class="block-text common-p-1" id="ach-2">This project could not have taken place without the dedication of numerous individuals. The goal of honoring and remembering Michigan Holocaust Survivors is being realized because of their efforts.
              Initially, Sinai Hospital of Detroit and the Jewish Fund of the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit helped support Portraits of Honor as an exhibit of photographs and biographies which toured schools and institutions.
              In conjunction with the traveling exhibit, Holocaust Survivors spoke to groups at the schools about their experiences. </p>
            <p class="block-text common-p-1">As part of the Program for Holocaust Survivors and Families, a service of Jewish Senior Life of Metropolitan Detroit,
              this project has developed into a permanent, electronic, interactive exhibit housed at the Holocaust Memorial Center Zekelman Family Campus, and

            <p class="block-text common-p-1" id="ach-3">
              There were 401 Holocaust Survivors featured in the initial opening of Portraits of Honor:
              Our Michigan Holocaust Survivors in 2011. Portraits of Honor has evolved and grown since its origin in 1999.
            </p>
            <p class="block-text common-p-1">
              In 2014, an additional 147 Survivors were added to Portraits of Honor totaling 548 Holocaust Survivors.
              Our goal is to continue to add more Survivor photographs and biographies to the Project.
            </p>
            <p class="block-text common-p-1">
              A Holocaust Survivor is defined by AMCHA , the National Israeli Center for Psychosocial Support of Holocaust Survivors and the Second Generation ,
              as any Jew who lived under
              Nazi occupation during the second World War and who was thus threatened by the policy of the "final solution" but stayed alive.
            </p>
            <p class="block-text common-p-1">
              According to this definition, persons with widely different Holocaust experiences are considered to be Holocaust Survivors.
              For example, those who were confined to a ghetto, who were in forced labor camps, who were imprisoned in concentration camps,
              who were in hiding or living under false identities, refugees who left their families behind, those who fought with the partisans,
              or those who were sent away in the "Kindertransport," those who were children, etc. All of these people were traumatized in one way or another,
              either by constant threat of being killed,
              having suffered significant losses, or having lived under the shadow of Holocaust persecution.
            </p>
            <p class="block-text common-p-1">
              We encourage people to learn more about our Michigan Survivors through extensive oral history interviews available at the John J.
